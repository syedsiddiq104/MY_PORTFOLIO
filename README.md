# MY_PORTFOLIO
I'm Syed Siddiq, a passionate and dedicated developer focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and I'm currently expanding my skills in full stack development. I love learning new tools, solving problems, and turning ideas into working software.
